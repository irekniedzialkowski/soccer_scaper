Soccer scraper site improvements
- a top bar to change the day of the matches, 
  side arrows to select different days, 
  3 days as button on one view - side arrows to change the view,
  today always stays in the view, 
  either on the right or at the left/middle
- additional date button to select day via callendar
- League table addition and league identifiier on site
- Side score table with different UI, 
  1 team per row, each match contained in 2 rows, 
  a dashed seperator to seperate teams from the same match
  colored minute of the match, grey the hour of the match - depending on the status
- match status - finished, during, postponed, not started
- additional attribute in flashscore table - match status
- scrollable sidebar with scores

Later:
List of all matches: 
- match with 1 team per row, same row the play button 
  which opens a window with all the goal/hihglights, 
  and additonal + button with follow functionality, 
  adds a match to main site, minus button unfollows the match or league


Some additional ideas:
a horizontal bar with 4 day options, with a dropdown menu on click,
animating to scroll through options.
